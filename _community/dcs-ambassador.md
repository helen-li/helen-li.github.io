* Conducted weekly mock technical interviews virtually over Zoom
* Hosted resume reviews and Q&A sessions on an on-demand basis
* Updated the department's job board with internship and new grad opportunities every week
* Presented at outreach events like Fall Campus Day 2023 and Program Exploration Day 2024
* Helped prepare for departmental events like Alumni-Student Mentorship Orientation and Convocation
* Led campus tours for visiting prospective students and their families

#### 2022-2023

I was invited as a student speaker for the department presentation at the university's open house event known as the Fall Campus Day. 
As a guide, I also led campus tours around the CS buildings and facilities in groups of 30-50 for prospective students and their families.
