#### 2023-2024

The ambassadors program was reconstructed, and I became one of the 6 chosen student leaders. 
In particular, I managed all project related to careers with a partner.

#### 2022-2023

I was invited as a student speaker for the department presentation at the university's open house event (known as the Fall Campus Day). 
As a guide, I also led campus tours around the CS buildings and facilities in groups of 30-50 for prospective students and their families.
