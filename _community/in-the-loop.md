Two amazing professors invited me to share my first-year internship search experience and the time I spent at Microsoft as an Explore intern. 
Our conversation went on to become the opening episode of <a href="https://dcs-utoronto-in-the-loop.simplecast.com/">In the Loop</a>, the department's first podcast, which was designed with the intention of empowering more students interested in computer science. 

A sneak peek of my perspective on the interview preparation process.
