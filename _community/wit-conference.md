In collaboration with the <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/home/index/">Microsoft Reactor</a> as a <a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/studentambassadors">Microsoft Student Ambassador</a>, I was invited to host a workshop for the Women in Tech Conference held at the Microsoft Toronto office.

This was my first time as a workshop host! While nervous, it was so fun and inspiring to connect with so many individuals looking to start their careers in tech.
