Menstruation nation is a mobile application for tracking periods, viewing cycle history, and learning fun facts about menstruation, built with a team of 9 undergrads at <a href="https://uoftblueprint.org/">UofT Blueprint</a> across 8 months. 

My team worked in close collaboration with the Privacy Pro for the Period Purse, a nonprofit organization passionate about menstrual education and de-stigmatizing.
