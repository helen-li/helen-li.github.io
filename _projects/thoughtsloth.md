Thoughtsloth is a mobile application that serves as a personal electronic bullet journal and mood tracker, built in less than 36 hours at Canada's largest hackathonâ€”Hack the North 2021.

I proposed the project idea and worked with a team of 4 novice hackers as my first university hackathon experience!
As a developer, I built majority of the application in Android Studio and trained a natural language processing model using TensorFlow to predict the types of emotions present in a given text.
