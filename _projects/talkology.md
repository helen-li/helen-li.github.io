Talkology is a full-stack web application that provides quantitative feedback on the speaking quality of an audio clip, built in less than 36 hours at Canada's largest hackathonâ€”Hack the North 2022.

I proposed the project idea and led a team of 4 throughout the hackathon. 
Beyond ticket delegation and management of the dev process, I worked intensively as a developer to write backend API calls to AssemblyAI for speech-to-text and sentiment analysis, build the Flask app server, bridge the UI with the backend, and refactor some React code for the frontend dashboard.
