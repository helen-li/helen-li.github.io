I'm an undergrad at the University of Toronto studying CS and Statistics with focuses in AI and NLP. 
<!-- This past summer, I was a software engineer at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) Azure App Service and a ML fellow at [AI4Good Lab](https://www.ai4goodlab.com/).  -->

My research interest in human-centered artificial intelligence falls at the intersection of HCI and AI. In the past, I've worked on tackling gender bias in generative text-to-image models, crafting design principles for context-aware smart assistants, and leveraging ML for menstrual health.

I lead projects for social good and advocate for gender diversity in tech.
